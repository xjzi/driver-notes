# FPGA notes
[Encoder and decoder for 8b/10b](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/ip-cores/communication-controller/8b10b-encdec/)
This transciever is written in VHDL, which seems like some kind of generic language that can be applied to any type of FPGA.
Intel and AMD both make FPGAs.
A low-end one would cost from \$8 - \$35.
The development kits cost thousands of dollars, so we would have to design our own board.
I'm not sure but I think we would just need a simple board with power and a SATA slot out.
PCB assembly could cost around \$10 per piece.
I know a couple of people who could help with designing a PCB.
